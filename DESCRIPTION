Description: OrthologAL leverages the data mining tool biomaRt to access different gene sets from ENSEMBL, and  facilitates the interaction with these servers without the need for any scripting , 
             Researchers can effortlessly input their Seurat object, a standard datatype format for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), single-nuclei RNA sequencing, or spatial transcriptomics data of any species, 
             and OrthologAL will output a human-gene converted Seurat object for download.
